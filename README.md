探索web世界
    大家好，由于考研并没有找工作，最近闲来无事在家除了准备复试也回顾下之前在学校实验室学过的前端知识。
    这段时间由于疫情影响我有了很长空余的时间，对未来的职业做了规划，准备之后向这个方向发展。
    github是前段时间学的，所以用的不是很好，特意建了一个仓库回顾之前学的东西。
      
    Translation：Hello everyone, because the postgraduate examination did not find a job, recently I have nothing to do at home. 
    In addition to preparing for a retest, I also review the web knowledge I learned in the school laboratory.
    During this period, I had a long free time due to the impact of the epidemic. 
    I planned my future career and prepared to move in this direction.
    github was learned some time ago, so it is not very good, and a warehouse was specifically built to review what I learned before.
    
    
    
    这个仓库主要算是个练习的仓库吧，做的都是入门的html+css+js小demo。
    
    Translation：This warehouse is mainly a practice warehouse. It is a small html + css + js demo.
    
    
    
    好看的皮囊千篇一律，有趣的灵魂万里挑一。
